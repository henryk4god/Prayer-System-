# CHAPTER FIVE: Gratitude & Intercession Prayer Guide

> "Gratitude fuels joy. Intercession fuels impact."
> —Henry, The Prayer System Pro

## INTRODUCTION

Two of the most overlooked yet powerful forms of prayer are:

1. **Gratitude prayers** — acknowledging God's goodness
2. **Intercessory prayers** — standing in the gap for others

This chapter will show you:

- How to pray with a heart full of thanksgiving
- How to develop daily gratitude rituals
- How to build and manage your personal intercession list
- What to say when you don't know how to pray for others

## SECTION 1: THE POWER OF GRATITUDE IN PRAYER

Gratitude isn't just polite—it's a spiritual weapon. When you focus on what God has done, fear fades and faith grows.

> "Give thanks in all circumstances..." —1 Thessalonians 5:18

### BENEFITS OF GRATITUDE PRAYER

1. **Shifts focus** from stress to trust
2. **Builds emotional resilience**
3. **Multiplies joy**
4. **Opens your heart** to receive more

### HOW TO PRAY GRATITUDE DAILY

Use the **"3-3-3 Rule"** every morning or night:

| Focus Area | What to Do |
|------------|------------|
| **3 Things You're Thankful For** | Big or small—be specific and honest |
| **3 Past Prayers God Answered** | From last week, last year, or last season |
| **3 Things You're Believing For** | Declare future blessings as already done in faith |

### SAMPLE GRATITUDE PRAYER

> "Lord, I thank You for breath in my lungs, food on my table, and peace in my home.
>
> Thank You for answering my prayer about my job last month.
> Thank You for the unseen ways You protected me today.
>
> Even for what hasn't happened yet—I thank You in advance for Your favor, healing, and wisdom."

> **Key Insight:** Gratitude is prophetic. It thanks God for what He's done—and what He's about to do.

## SECTION 2: THE INTERCESSION PRAYER LIST

Intercession is selfless prayer. It's what Jesus is doing for us right now (Hebrews 7:25). When you pray for others, you partner with God's heart for the world.

### HOW TO BUILD YOUR INTERCESSION LIST

Break it down by relationship and responsibility. Here's a simple framework:

#### Personal Circle
- Spouse / children
- Siblings / parents
- Close friends

#### Spiritual Circle
- Pastors / mentors
- Church leadership
- Fellow believers facing trials

#### Community & Leadership
- Government officials
- Bosses / workplace leaders
- Local schools or ministries

#### Struggling & Vulnerable
- Sick / hospitalized
- Widows, orphans, refugees
- People battling addiction or grief

### SAMPLE INTERCESSION LOG TEMPLATE

| Name | Prayer Focus | Scripture to Declare | Status |
|------|--------------|---------------------|---------|
| **Mom** | Healing from back pain | Isaiah 53:5 | Ongoing |
| **Pastor John** | Wisdom for Sunday sermon | James 1:5 | Praying weekly |
| **Sarah (friend)** | Restoration in her marriage | Ephesians 3:20 | Updated: April 2 |
| **Local School** | Protection & peace on campus | Psalm 91 | Monthly check-in |

### SAMPLE INTERCESSION PRAYERS

#### For Healing:
> "Lord, I lift up [Name]. Your Word says by Your stripes we are healed. Restore their body and spirit. Bring comfort and peace."

#### For Salvation:
> "Father, open the eyes of [Name] to see Your truth. Draw them by Your Spirit. Break every lie and lead them to salvation."

#### For Guidance:
> "God, give [Name] wisdom beyond their years. Let them walk in Your will and avoid every trap of the enemy."

#### For Strength:
> "Lord, strengthen [Name] in their weakness. Give them grace for today and hope for tomorrow. Be their refuge."

### TIPS TO STAY CONSISTENT WITH INTERCESSION

- ✅ **Choose 3–5 people** to focus on each week
- ✅ **Set reminders** using a prayer app or journal
- ✅ **Text someone** when you pray for them—it encourages both of you
- ✅ **Review and update** your list monthly

> "Your intercession may be the only prayer someone ever receives. Be faithful with it."
